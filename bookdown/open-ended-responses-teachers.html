The students were very well engaged during the program. They loved performing during the Arts integrated piece. It was learning through the Arts.

The students learning about composting in many ways and how to take care of the environment: hip hop, tap dance, visual presentations, making of projects

In your opinion, what changes have you observed in your students after they attended and completed the eARThKids program? (e.g., changes in attentiveness, behavior, critical thinking skills, art, others). Please provide an example(s) of one or more student(s) to illustrate the change. Any anecdotes that you can share will be good.

<td style="text-align:left;">
One student who usually struggles with involvement graciously participated in every task he was asked to perform.
</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">
The students became very creative and were willing to participate.
</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The eARTHKids group are already practicing how to throw their stuff properly and it is clearly shown as they eat their supper before they start the after school. It is putting what they learn into practice.

<th style="text-align:left;">
One of the goals of the eARThKids program is for teachers to integrate the arts when an artist is not in the room. Please provide a brief example or two of a time that you integrated the arts into your curriculum when an artist was not present.

After studying on how to make worm bins, I introduced the students to the three layers of soil, use their sight word to create an art project.
</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">
The teacher worked hand in hand with the Artist.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
When my students were putting the concept into an action to understand the meaning. They did a simple tableau.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I taught the first hour each time, which allowed me to teach an integrated lesson, individually. This allowed the students to get the “core understanding” of what was to follow and it allowed them to be exposed to new vocabulary.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
As a RELA teacher , I was able to integrate arts using varied entry points in the teaching - learning process through songs and actions . I also used some art crafts to encourage students to apply what they have learned .

Please describe the quality of your interactions with the teacher artist(s) who came to your school? (e.g., type of discussions, co-teach, co-plan a lesson, plan to improve the lesson, ways to engage the students better, etc).

Artist and I collaborated on plan lessons and work flow.

We discussed how to better work with the students. What can we do to better help the students? Incentives for the students.
</td>

<td style="text-align:left;">
So far we have a co - teach style of engaging the students considering the most part that is best for them. We make adjustments together to reach the objectives for the day.

It was positive and motivating! She always had an excited attitude and we were both “in sync” regarding the planning and delivery of each lesson.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
We begin collaborating on what materials the students are going to work on , the questions and activities we are going to use and the end goal for each day. As for behavior management , both the artist and the teacher will assist each other to ensure smooth transition and learning.

At the end of each period we can have a celebration and give the students a certificate for attending.

The type of dismissal the school has for the kids, that will matter as to the staff who needs to stay until dismissal time ( William Paca has car riders and bus dismissal.)

More reading resources specifically about the environment that the students may read and require them to analyze the story and look for key details in the text.

The program is a great opportunity for the kids to learn how to take care of the environment at their young age and at the same time integrate and enhance their reading skills through the art.

The program has helped the students to be better listeners and participants in the teaching - learning process.
