The students lesson focused on Composting. In the sessions they learned what, how, and why they should compost as well as 6 site words with beat and rhythm patterns. Students also connected three steps of the compost process to a tap step to create a Compost Tap Dance. Also within each session the students practiced using their site words in a sentence, create a compost collage, and present their creations for an audience.

I’d suggest creating time the weekend before with the artist and teacher to get together and make sure each other is clear on the lesson plan and needs for the residency week. I think this could be done/ scheduled between the teacher and the artist.

In your opinion, what changes have you observed in the students after they attended and completed the eARThKids program? (e.g., changes in attentiveness, behavior, critical thinking skills, art, others). Please provide an example(s) of one or more student(s) to illustrate the change. Any anecdotes that you can share will be good.

Ability to work together, critical thinking.

I observed students who were once apprehensive begin to come out of their shell. In each culminating presentation that students stood in front of an audience and performed. Some students had special parts where the stood and spoke on what they learned about composting and they spoke clearly.

<td style="text-align:left;">
Songwriting is an advanced skill, but using my magnetic words and rhymes over 4 days, students were able to grow more and more successful with it each day. Students that have trouble with spelling of handwriting didn’t have to struggle with those elements using the magnetic words. Using color-coded phrases and rhymes, they could succeed on a simple level pretty quickly, but with repetition they expanded their lyrics to incorporate more vocabulary about birds and more nuanced ideas and poetic beauty. We used 8 different phrases which could be made into rhyming couplets. Students worked individually or with a partner. By the last day, several group had written all 8 couplets, whereas they had only completed one or two on the first day.

One of the goals of the eARThKids program is for teachers to integrate the arts when an artist is not in the room. Please provide a brief example or two of a time that you integrated the arts into your curriculum when an artist was not present.

Please describe the quality of your interactions with the teacher(s) at the school? (e.g., type of discussions, co-planning a lesson, developing a lesson plan, plan to improve the lesson, ways to engage the students better, etc).

Working together in class- supporting each other, improvising, helping the kids was all great.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
I had great interactions with each of the teachers at all the schools. Before each session I made sure to ask the teacher if there were any specific items that should be adjusted and they all loved the flow of the class. I especially liked the way the teacher and I flowed through the lesson plans and piggy backed off of each other.

Timing always an issue. Intentions were always good.

My partner was always in a rush. She mostly just let me take the lead, which was fine, but it would have been nice if she had engaged more in the arts part. She was, however, very kind and enthusiastic.

All 5 of the teachers with whom I worked were enthusiastic at the end of long work days and able to flexibly adjust lessons as we saw what had worked, or hadn’t work, at previous sites.

I think that teachers were often new to arts integration, so it was a valuable experience for them to see how as new AI lesson works.

Had a challenging, but successful time at all three schools. Would prefer a residency during school time.
